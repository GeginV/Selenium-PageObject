Introduction
------------

This repository contains basic example of usage PageObject
patter with Selenium and Python (PyTest + Selenium). 

The entire setup was taken from https://github.com/TimurNurlygayanov/ui-tests-example. 

The only thing I take credit for is the implementation of the setup that you can see in 'tests' folder. There you will find me playing around with selenium: 
1. Making it wait (explicitly, implicitly)
2. Making action chains
3. Trying to log in
4. Using a cookie
5. Using a JS script

Requirements
------------
Python 3 + all packages listed in 'requirements.txt'
